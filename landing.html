			<p>
				Paladem is a 2-D platform game using the Unity 4.3 game engine. The basic story elements unravel as the protagonist attempts to rescue a girl who claims to be the his sister, trapped in an underground facility. The game incorporates traditional platform game mechanics while integrating more complex powers and magical themes. Using these abilities, the player will face various mysteries of the environment including several non-playable characters (NPCs) that will be encountered throughout the game. The plot of Paladem is primarily told through in-game items and interactions with the aforementioned NPCs.  Players must piece together the vague information they uncover in order to understand the story, rather than having it laid out by dialogue within the game.
